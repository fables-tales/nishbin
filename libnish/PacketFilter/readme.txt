Basically, the PacketFilter will be responsible for making sure we aren't being flooded with packets, looking for peers trying to take advantage of fairly trusting
model, etc.  It will also be responsible for kicking any peers doing the above, and blacklisting them.

All in all, it'll be fairly essential when the project is finally released to the great unwashed, but until then i'm going to completely neglect it, so that i actually
stand a chance of getting some functionality in.  lowers my activation energy, don't cha know.
